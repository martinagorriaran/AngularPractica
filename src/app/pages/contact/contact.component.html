    <h4 id="list-item-1">Origin</h4>
    <p>OMORI was created as a much older boy on a blog by OMOCAT called omori ひきこもり, which lasted from 22 Dec 2011 to 14 Mar 2012. He introduces himself as OMORI, who likes to play old games. He wears a black tanktop, striped shorts, and long black socks.</p>

    <p>The blog features OMORI with simple phrases in the WHITE SPACE which are rather depressing or they contemplate about life. Common items shown in the blog are a black lightbulb, his cat, his laptop, his Game Boy, a tissue box, his blanket, and a knife. It contains some dark images and an insight into his character and depression. In a few of the scenes, he nearly kills himself.</p>
      
    <p>The blog appears to end when OMORI cannot access his laptop anymore. It is unknown whether or not this is intentional or coincidental.</p>
      
    <p>OMORI'S STORY is a short story about OMORI and his colorful neighbors. Besides the Kickstarter, this STORY and a POSTER were the only things sold as merchandise by OMOCAT. You can no longer buy the STORY in the OMOCAT SHOP.</p>
      
    <p>The OMORI SKETCHBOOK is featured on the OMORI GAME website. The SKETCHBOOK shows many drawings by OMORI, some shown in the game's SKETCHBOOK in WHITE SPACE.</p>
      
    <p>The OMORI GRAPHIC NOVEL was the initial idea for OMOCAT to bring OMORI's story to a larger project. It is now a discontinued graphic novel to make way for the OMORI game, as OMOCAT had a much bigger vision to tell this story.</p>
